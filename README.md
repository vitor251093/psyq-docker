# PsyQ on Docker
Code and compile your PsyQ projects in any Windows 10 Pro, Linux and macOS computer, using only Docker.

This is still a WIP. It does not work.

## How do I use it?
Place your source code inside the src folder (you must have a main.c and a makefile.mak file), and place the PSYQ_SDK.zip file in the root folder of this project. Then, using a Terminal, go to the docker folder and run the docker-reset.sh file.
